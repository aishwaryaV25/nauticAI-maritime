## 🎯 What is NautiCAI?

NautiCAI is an end-to-end AI inspection system that detects structural defects in underwater infrastructure — **pipelines, subsea cables, vessel hulls, and port structures** — from images and video feeds.

It automatically generates professional **PDF inspection reports** with risk scoring, Gaussian heatmaps, and QR-verified digital records — replacing a process that traditionally costs **USD 500,000+** per inspection and takes days, with an AI solution that works in **seconds**.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔬 **19-class defect detection** using YOLOv8s — Corrosion, Crack, Fracture, Marine Growth, Biofouling, Weld Defect + 13 more
- 🎨 **Visibility enhancement pipeline** — CLAHE, Green-Water filter, Turbidity correction, Edge Estimator
- 🌡️ **Gaussian risk heatmap** — visualises damage concentration zones using plasma colourmap
- 📊 **Structural Risk Score (0–100)** with Grade A–D classification system
- 📄 **Auto-generated PDF report** — annotated image, heatmap, detection log, severity chart, recommendations, QR code
- 📦 **CSV data export** for structured record keeping
- 🔗 **SHA-256 QR code** digital report verification
- 🎥 **Video analysis** — frame-by-frame detection on uploaded ROV footage
- 🚀 **Edge deployment ready** — NVIDIA Jetson Orin at ~55 FPS (TensorRT INT8)
